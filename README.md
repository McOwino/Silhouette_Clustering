# Silhouette_Clustering
This project showcases the application of K-Means clustering, a popular unsupervised machine learning technique, along with the Silhouette Score metric to assess clustering quality. K-Means is widely used for data segmentation and pattern recognition, making it a valuable tool for various domains.

Key Features:

K-Means Clustering: Explore how K-Means partitions data into clusters, making it easier to identify patterns and group similar data points together.

Silhouette Score: Learn how to use the Silhouette Score to measure the quality and separation of clusters. A higher score indicates better-defined clusters.

Python Implementation: The project provides a Python implementation using popular libraries like scikit-learn for K-Means clustering and Silhouette Score calculation.

Example Dataset: We include a sample dataset and a step-by-step guide to walk you through the entire process, making it easy to understand and apply in your own projects.

Data Visualization: Visualize your clustered data to gain insights and make data-driven decisions.
